2006-03-01  Scott G. Miller <sgmiller@gmail.com>

    * Fixed bug in multiline comment parsing - expressions after a
      multiline comment weren't always read correctly.  See bug
      1441078.

2006-02-28  Scott G. Miller <sgmiller@gmail.com>

      e.g. during sessions deserialisation in a J2EE container.

    * Deprecated named application contexts.

      name. This fixes bug 1375026, where Java serialisation of
      continuations would end up serialising large chunks of the heap.

2006-02-14  Scott G. Miller <sgmiller@gmail.com>

    * Modify the signal hooking mechanisms to make their callbacks
      in the same dynamic environment in which they were registered,

      info-less frames from the stack trace.

    * Require a Charset for the creation of SourceInputPorts.

    * Make the default Scheme port for DynamicEnvironment and
      the REPL Listen socket a character port.

2006-01-10  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Updated srfi-13 to latest reference implementation, which fixes
      a bug in |string-concatenate-reverse/shared|, and also replaces
      our stop-gap fix to a bug in |string-contains|.

    * Fixed a bug in srfi-13 reference implementation that resulted in
      string comparison predicates returning numeric values instead of
      #t. See bug 1400758.

2005-12-04  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed bug in |parameterize| - escaping continuations now capture
      the current value of parameters. See bug 1372516.

      types and classes. This fixes the long-outstanding record
      serialisation bug 806864.

    * Made all core types and types in libraries (i.e. srfis)
      non-generative.

2005-11-11  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

      have an associated module and appear as pre-imported libraries.

2005-10-28  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

      not registering the srfi as a feature.

2005-10-11  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed bug in |string-append| - it was not copying the string
      when called with a single argument. See bug 1320677.

2005-10-09  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Made sisc.data.Pair.{car,cdr} private. NB: This may break
      existing Java code that manipulates SISC values; such code
      should use the provided accessor/modifier methods instead.

    * Fixed bug in |read-string| that allowed modification of
      immutable strings. See bug 1320475.

2005-10-03  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

      hit too early in some boundary cases.

    * Fixed a mysterious problem with ROUND, in some boundary cases.

    * Made double-precision floating point the default (previously it
      was arbitrary precision)

2005-08-16  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed (or, rather, added) hash codes for boxes and uninterned
      symbols. This was breaking things when these kinds of values
      were used in equal?-based hash tables, for example.

2005-08-12  Scott G. Miller  <sgmiller@gmail.com>

    * Fix serious bug in the logic for AppExp when reverting

      type is 'void' (feature 1111637).

2005-05-05  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed arity-bug in vector-fill! (bug 1195709).

    * Made slib support a loadable library.

2005-04-29  Scott G. Miller  <sgmiller@gmail.com>

      problems with serialization.  Thanks to Allesandro Colomba
      for spotting the bug.

2005-04-29  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

      an untrace then trace when a traced procedure is redefined.

2005-04-15  Scott G. Miller  <sgmiller@gmail.com>

    * More efficiently fixed bug 1181453.
      Not copying the VLR in Closure on infinite-arity procedures
      can in rare cases corrupt a captured continuation.
      Moved most of the rest-args logic into Interpreter.

2005-02-19  Scott G. Miller  <sgmiller@gmail.com>

    * Made the default serialization for Expressions to throw
      an error.  This will trickle down to non-serializable expressions
      like threads, I/O ports, etc.

2005-02-14  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed a bug in syntax-object->datum and hence define-macro. See

2005-01-16  Scott G. Miller  <sgmiller@gmail.com>

    * Fixed a bug where the SLL2 serializer was writing the
      string length rather than the number of bytes in its
      representation length, breaking deserialization.

    * Removed inline-primitives and inline-usual-primitives, as
      this is done automatically and safely now.

    * Applied two contributed patches: one which fixes the
      project's Maven description, and another that searches
      for sisc.shp in the SISC jar library if not found through
      other means.  Both are courtesy of Matthew Daniel.

2005-01-11  Scott G. Miller  <sgmiller@gmail.com>

    * Added permissive-parsing parameter, which when true, causes

    we can use the 1.8 optimizer instead of one which
    preserves the metadata

    * Reimplemented the Analyzer in Scheme rather than Java.

2004-05-13  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed bug in s2j that resulted in incorrect method lookup
    precedence for methods overloaded on java.lang.Object and an

      for R5RS compatibility.

2002-11-21  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Added missing serialization methods to some obscure data types -
      there absence would have caused continuation serialization to

    * Made S2J's Java nulls typed, which, amongst other benefits,
      allows them to be used for generic procedure method selection.

    * Removed S2J object mutation (java-new and java-set!). It's not

2002-04-13  Scott G. Miller  <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * load now sets the current directory to the directory
      of the source file its loading, and resets it when done.

      and enhancements

2002-03-15  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Fixed SQRT for large integers, with the side effect
      of producing exact results for exact arguments with an exact
      square root.

    * Added annotation support, which will allow source-correlated
      error messages.

2002-03-09  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Fixed equality problems with Immutables

    * Modified REPL to allow third party applications to load

2002-03-08  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed access violation problems in generic functions when
      sub-classes have more restrictive permissions than base
      classes. The fix restricts the visiblity of non-public
      classes/interfaces/methods.

    * Added mechanism to throw Java exceptions from Scheme code and
      propagating them back to Java code if the Scheme code was called
      from Java.

    * Defined modules for SRFIs 0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,23,24.

    * Added the DEFINE-ALIAS, FROM, and IMPORT* forms as defined in
      Chez Scheme.

2002-02-16  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Fixed two bugs in SNative's append.  First is that the last
      (in this case second) argument to append can be any object. Second
      is that that R5RS mandates that everything *but* the last is
      newly allocated.

2002-02-15  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Added new, experimental Scheme->Java interface module

2002-02-14  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Added parameter (vector-length-prefixing) which
      specified whether pretty-print should display the prefixed
      length of a vector.

2002-02-12  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Fixed CHAR-UPPER-CASE? and CHAR-LOWER-CASE?

    * Changed COMPOSE so it takes 0..n args

2002-02-11  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Modified serialization format to support non-stream
      data sources

2002-02-06  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Upgraded to the latest syntax expander.  This fixes
      a couple of bugs regarding module imports.

      can be serialized once.

2002-02-05  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Added support for legacy macros (defmacro and define-macro)

2002-02-04  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Added support for the common ASCII escape sequences (i.e. \n, \r
      etc) when reading/writing strings.

    * Fixed bug in string comparison.

    * Fixed bug that gave wrong #f results in EQUAL? when comparing
      mutable to immutable objects.

    * Fixed bug in PEEK-CHAR - \#nul was not being pushed back after
      being read.

    * Added literal notation for case-sensitive symbols (|Foo|) and a
      prim for toggling global case-sensitivity.

2002-01-30 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Changed Primitive's throw RuntimeExceptions to
          throwPrimExceptions.

    * Corrected error reporting of invalid indices to strings

      the same.

2002-01-24 Released r1.3.1

2002-01-22 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Fixed a bug in Symbol serialization that affected
          improper deserialization of uninterned or case sensitive
          symbols (SGM)

2002-01-11 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * java/import can now take a String as the class/object
      argument, which will be resolved into a class

2001-12-28  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Fixed locking thinko that broke the mutex goal :(

    * Added monitor/synchronize-unsafe, which does *not* use
      dynamic-wind but runs an order of magnitude faster

    * Made monitor/synchronize[-unsafe] take one or more
      expressions to synchronize rather than just one.

2001-12-24  Release 1.3.0

2001-12-16  Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Implemented Scheme level threading and synchronzation

    * Fixed a division by zero error in the refined Quantity classes

2001-12-14  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Implemented clean interface for calling Scheme from Java,
    including support for multiple applications and multiple threads

    * Fixed and optimized several multi-threading issues

2001-12-13  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Removed current-writer, was only used by repl which now just
    calls pretty-print directly

2001-12-04  Matthias Radestock  <matthias@sorted.org>

    * Made literal strings, vectors and lists immutable

2001-12-04  Scott G. Miller  <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Fixed string->number, which should have been able to accept
      #[xobd]num format numbers as well as ordinary ones.

    * Fixed string->number handling of ""

    * Fixed sqrt on negative floating point values

        * Fixed error in lexer's handling of EOF.

    * Removed String constructor for Quantities, rely
      on valueOf, which requires much less needless instantiation.

    * Fixed precision loss during serialization/deserialization

    * Fixed handling of uncertain digits in exact numbers.

        * Added Thread support (preliminary)

        * Fixed equals? handling of immutable data (more specifically,
          equals? handling of subclasses of values)

12/1/2001 Scott G. Miller <scgmille@freenetproject.org>

    * Removed BeginExp, DefineExp, FreeSetExp, IfExp, and LexicalSetExp,
          which were replaced with EvalExp, which simply evaluates
          an expression and pushes another onto the stack (the second being
          the corresponding Eval)

r1.2.3  Performance enhancements

        * Added ashr, the complement to ashl.

    * In fixing other reader errors, 1.2.2 fixed hex digit handling.
      Fixed.

    * exact? and inexact? should error on non-numbers.  They
      weren't.  Fixed.

    * eqv? in scheme was relying on above bug for correct operation.

r1.2.2  Minor enhancements, bug fixes

    * Output ports do not automatically flush now (except for
      console out).

    * Added 'flush-output-port' which takes an output port
       and finalizes any writes

    * Added an optional parameter to open-output-file and
      get-socket-output-port, <autoflush>, a boolean.  If
      #t, the port will flush after every write.

    * #\return wasn't recognized on read, but could be produced
          on write.  Fixed.

    * (null-environment) was returning a completely empty
      environment, which is incorrect in SISC, since the special
      forms (quote, lambda, etc) should still be present.  Fixed.

    * Fixed an inaccuracy in the reader, where "<radix> <exactness>
          could not be used.

     * Somewhat fixed the parser wrt the unspecified digit, '#'.
      Still somewhat broken in that the presence of a '#' does not
          force inexactness.

r1.2.1  Bugfixes

    * Ratio simplification now properly handles numerator
      and denominator signs sanely.

    * Full-sisc now includes J2S, Netlib, Exec, and Debug

r1.2.0  Major enhancements

    * New serialization structure.  The heap can be serialized in 1/3
          the space, and we can shave .7 seconds off SISC startup time.
          Also, the heap isn't tied to a specific version of SISC.
      (Not present in sisc-lite)

    * Dead code eliminated

    * Default Quantity lib is now double precision floating point
      instead of arbitrary precision.  In the future, the library
          will be selectable at startup

    * Some minor performance tweaks

r1.1.3  Bug fixes (Never formally released)

    * Added continuation? type checker

    * Fixed scalability issue in Pair.display.  Couldn't handle
      incredibly large lists because it was using a recursive
      print method (which doesnt work well in Java, stack smash)

r1.1.2  Bug fixes

    * Fixed startup scripts for windows

    * Cross-platform path handling (only tested on Windows/Unix atm)

    * Tidied up SLIB initialization file

    * Limiting lexical depth to 65536, function argument count to
          65536

r1.1.1  Bug fixes, code cleaning

    * Startup scripts werent able to load files, fixed

    * Error in the syntax expander wasnt handling final cdr
          unquotes in a quasi-quoted list

    * Vector printing optimizations

    * Scheme source optimized and tidied to hide scaffolding functions

r1.1.0  Many many changes.  v1.1.0 is on average 45% faster than 1.0.3

    Reimplementation of global environments as a simple flat array.

        * LexicalEnvironments don't need symbol information,
          this was an old debugging mode that isn't necessary.
          Result is a smaller heap and small boost to
          performance.

        Added Matthias Radestock's optimizations:
        * replace recursion with loops in LexicalEnvironment.lookup and
      LexicalEnvironment.set => no noticable difference, but might
          show in deeply nested expressions

    * recycler for FillRibExp along the same lines as CallFrames.
      This gives a 5-10% performance boost.

    * creation of {*}Eval instances in constructor of
      {FreeSet,If,LexicalSet}Expr, rather than in eval method.
      Shifts the burden from runtime to compile time and results in
      ~5% performance boost.

        Added Immediates, which fill the value rib directly (16% bonus)

        Compiler now eliminates Immediates from effect context.  Example:
       (begin (set! a 3) 5 a) => (begin (set! a 3) a)
           (begin 1 a (lambda (x) x) #t) => #t
        and chooses branches with a decidable constant test-exp:
           (if 3 1 2) => 1
           (if #f 1 2) => 2

        Made SISC thread safe.  Also added two new methods in Interpreter:

        * newContext(Interpreter):  Creates a new Interpreter context
          in which expressions can be interpreted.  By having multiple
          Interpreter contexts, you can run multiple scheme programs in the
          same environment simultaneously (multithreaded scheme).

        * eval(String): Evaluates the given String as a scheme expression in
          the current context and returns the resulting value.  This should
          be helpful for running scheme expressions from Java.

        Fixed a Ratio->Floating point conversion error in Quantity.

        Fixed R5RS env handling.  There were a number of side cases
        where the R5RS env was not immutable, or where shadowing the R5RS
        environment wasn't reflected in procedures defined before that
        shadowed binding.

        Fixed abs for complex numbers.
        Made procedures proper values.

        TODO: Add synchronization module to allow synchronization in scheme
              code.

r1.0.3  Cruft bug that disabled number->string
        Precision fixes so FP calculations respect max_precision
        Added setters/getters for max-precision and min-precision.  These
          can be used to set the minimum and maximum amount of precision
          allowed in a floating point calculation
        Some minor code cleanup
        Some minor speed improvements (very minor)
r1.0.2  Added Boxes back into the language since they were used in
        variable references.
r1.0.1    Fixed continuation capturing bug related to side-effects on the
        value rib.
r1.0.0    First public release.
